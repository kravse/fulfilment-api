# fullfillment api

Wanted to see if I could brush up on my python well enough to solve this again.

## Get Started:

1. Install python
2. Run `python main.py`

## Known Issues
* Restocking causes problems with editing items.
* Needs a proper logging service to give some more details.
* The orders service needs to be broken out into more micro-services for code clarity and cleanliness.
