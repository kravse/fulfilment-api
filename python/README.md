# fullfillment api

Wanted to see if I could brush up on my python well enough to solve this again.

## Get Started:

1. Install python
2. Run `python main.py`

## Known Issues
* Restocking causes problems with editing items.
* Needs a proper logging service to give some more details.
* All the issues in the javascript app are present here.
